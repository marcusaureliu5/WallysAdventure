# WallysAdventure
A text based roguelike adventure based in a rural US W@lMart, written in lua for the Panic Playdate

Rooms and items are procedurally generated

When the player physically turns to north, south, east and west, the crank can be used to move in that direction to explore the current room

Pressing B displays the pop up allowing the player to select a direction with A, which will move the player to a new explorable room
